# VS Code Azure Resources API

Born from a needed overhaul of the multi-Azure-extension user experience, this API allows any number of "client" extensions to contribute to and extend a set of unified resource views owned by a "host" extension.

## History

For \\\\Build 2022 we released our first version of what we call the App Centric or Unified redesign of the Azure extensions for VS Code. The redesign combines the Azure product views into a single view, called the Azure Resources view.

Below is a screenshot of the Azure panel before the redesign, with 5 product extensions installed. Each Azure product has its own view in the Azure panel, resulting in a congested and unproductive user experience. A primary goal of the redesign was to improve the user experience for users who use multiple Azure extensions simultaneously.

## Overview

The Azure Resources extension for VS Code contributes the **Azure resources view** and the **Workspace resources view**. The Azure view lets users browse and work with supported resources in Azure. The Workspace resources view is home to development related resources like an emulated database, or a functions project detected in an open workspace folder.

In the past, each supported Azure resource had a dedicated view in the Azure view container. In the updated design, the Azure resources and Workspace resources views contain all resources.
To facilitate this design, each Azure **product extension** contributes to a single **host extension**.

The Azure Resources extension provides small generic features for all Azure resource types. Users can then install Azure product extensions to enable rich, product-specific features.

The Azure Resources extension exposes an API which enables any number of client extensions to contribute UI and functionality to the Azure and Workspace resources views.

## Capabilities

## API Overview

### Branch data provider

The VS Code API provides a `TreeDataProvider` interface for controlling tree views. The host extension splits tree views into branches, where each branch is controlled by a branch data provider. Clients can register a `BranchDataProvider` which is then responsible for providing the tree items for a branch in the tree view. The `BranchDataProvider` interface is a small extension of VS Code's `TreeDataProvider`.

`BranchDataProvider` is an extension of [VS Code's `TreeDataProvider`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TreeDataProvider).

> Note: clients registering resource providers must declare that they do so in their extension manifest. See [Extension Manifest](#extension-manifest)

```ts
/**
 * The base interface for visualizers of Azure and workspace resources.
 */
export interface BranchDataProvider<TResource extends ResourceBase, TModel extends ResourceModelBase> extends vscode.TreeDataProvider<TModel> {
    /**
     * Get the children of `element`.
     *
     * @param element The element from which the provider gets children. Unlike a traditional tree data provider, this will never be `undefined`.
     *
     * @return Children of `element`.
     */
    getChildren(element: TModel): vscode.ProviderResult<TModel[]>;

    /**
     * Called to get the provider's model element for a specific resource.
     *
     * @remarks getChildren() assumes that the provider passes a known (TModel) model item, or undefined when getting the "root" children.
     *          However, branch data providers have no "root" so this function is called for each matching resource to obtain a starting branch item.
     *
     * @returns The provider's model element for `resource`.
     */
    getResourceItem(element: TResource): TModel | Thenable<TModel>;
}
```

Clients can register branch data providers for each resource view.

### Resource provider

Clients register resource providers to add resources to a view. Currently the API is limited to registering Workspace resource providers because a default Azure resource provider is built into the Azure Resources extension.

> Note: clients registering resource providers must declare that they do so in their extension manifest. See [Extension Manifest](#extension-manifest)

```ts
/**
 * The base interface for providers of Azure and workspace resources.
 */
export interface ResourceProvider<TResourceSource, TResource extends ResourceBase> {
    /**
     * Fired when the provider's resources have changed.
     */
    readonly onDidChangeResource?: vscode.Event<TResource | undefined>;

    /**
     * Called to supply the resources used as the basis for the resource views.
     *
     * @param source The source from which resources should be generated.
     *
     * @returns The resources to be displayed in the resource view.
     */
    getResources(source: TResourceSource): vscode.ProviderResult<TResource[]>;
}
```


## Extension manifest

Client extensions define an `x-azResources` object on inside of `contributes` in the extension manifest `package.json` file.

This object informs the host extension when to activate the client extension and what contributions the client extension makes to the shared views.

```ts
    azure?: {
        /**
         * List of Azure resource types this extension registers a BranchDataProvider for.
         */
        branches: {
            /**
             * The resource type the BranchDataProvider is registered for.
             */
            type: AzExtResourceType
        }[];
    };

    /**
     * List of Workspace resource types this extension registers a BranchDataProvider for.
     */
    workspace?: {
        branches: {
            /**
             * The resource type the BranchDataProvider is registered for.
             */
            type: string;
        }[];

        /**
         * Whether this extension registers a WorkspaceResourceProvider.
         */
        resources?: boolean;
    };

    /**
     * Commands to add to the "Create Resource..." quick pick prompt.
     */
    commands?: {
        command: string;
        title: string;
        detail: string;
    }[];
}
```

The contribution object from the Azure Functions extension is shown below as an example.

This extension declares that it registers a BranchDataProvider for the `FunctionApp` resource type in the Azure resources view, and a BranchDataProvider for the `func` resource type in the Workspace resources view. It also registers a WorkspaceResourceProvider. Finally, it contributes a command to the "Create Resource..." quick pick prompt for creating a Funciton App.


```jsonc
{
    "contributes": {
        "x-azResources": {
            "azure": {
                "branches": [
                    // extension registers a BranchDataProvider for Function Apps
                    {
                        "type": "FunctionApp"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "workspace": {
                "branches": [
                    // extension registers a BranchDataProvider for workspace resources of type "func"

                        "type": "func"
                    }
                ],
                // extension registers a WorkspaceResourceProvider
                "resources": true
            },
            "commands": [
                // extension contributes a command to the "Create Resource..." quick pick prompt
                {
                    "command": "azureFunctions.createFunctionApp",
                    "title": "%azureFunctions.createFunctionApp%",
                    "detail": "%azureFunctions.createFunctionAppDetail%"
                }
            ],
        },
        // other extension contributions
    }
}
```

## Getting started

On activation, client extensions can fetch an instance of the Host API by accessing the `exports` property of the Azure Resources extension.

```ts
import { AzureResourcesApi } from '@microsoft/vscode-azext-utils';

const extension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups');

if (extension) {
    if (!extension.isActive) {
        await extension.activate();
    }
    const apiProvider: AzureExtensionApiProvider = extension.exports;

    const hostApi = apiProvider.getApi<AzureResourcesApi>('2.0.0', {
        extensionId: 'client-extension-id'
    });

    const azureResourcesApi = hostApi.resources;
    // ...register providers
}
```


## Contribute to the Azure resources view
